I created this CRUD just to put my knowledge to the test.

It's a little bit clumsy and ugly, but it was just a quick project to see if I understood the CRUD basics.

The idea behind it is to view all the users, create a new user (I reused my Subscription to do it), and delete. The main objective was to simulate an admin that has all rights over the accounts.

My next plan is to implement this CRUD in an "e-commerce" type of project.

There's no documentation for the code. I plan to create it when I implement it in the e-commerce project.

If you have any questions about the implementation or the use of this code, send me a message through my LinkedIn (it's in my Git bio).

Thanks for reading!
